1. First create rpcgen by doing the following
	rpcgen date.x
 This generates date_clnt.c(client stub), date_svc.c(server stub), date.h(header file).
2. Compile the server program
	gcc -o server server.c date_svc.c
3. Compile the client program in a new terminal
	gcc -o client client.c 
4. Execute server
	./server
5. Execute client by also specifying Server's IP in the command line
	./client 172.20.0.161
